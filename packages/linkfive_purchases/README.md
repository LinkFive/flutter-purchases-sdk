# The Easiest Implementation of Subscriptions for Flutter

Add the plugin to your Flutter app:

```
 $ flutter pub add linkfive_purchases
```

## Getting Started

Initialize the SDK. [Read our more detailed docs](https://www.linkfive.io/docs/flutter/initializing/)

```dart
await LinkFivePurchases.init("LinkFive Api Key");
```

Get your API key after [Sign up](https://app.linkfive.io/sign-up?utm_source=flutter). It's free!

Fetch all available subscriptions from LinkFive. The result will be passed to the stream or returned as a Future. [Fetch Docs](https://www.linkfive.io/docs/flutter/show-subscription-offer/)

```dart
LinkFivePurchases.fetchProducts();

// or also

LinkFiveProducts? products = await LinkFivePurchases.fetchProducts(); 
```

### Product Streams

LinkFive mainly uses streams to send data to your application. [Active Subscriptions Docs](https://www.linkfive.io/docs/flutter/get-all-active-subscriptions/)

```dart
// Stream of Products to offer to the user
LinkFivePurchases.products

// Stream of purchased/active Products
LinkFivePurchases.activeProducts

// to get all offerings, do the following:
LinkFivePurchases.products.listen((LinkFiveProducts products) {
  print(products);
});

// or for all active Products, listen on .activeProducts
LinkFivePurchases.activeProducts.listen((LinkFiveActiveProducts activeProducts) {
  print(activeProducts);
});

```

### Purchase a Subscription

Simply call purchase and an object of ProductDetails which you got from the products stream. [Purchase Docs](https://www.linkfive.io/docs/flutter/make-a-purchase/)

```dart
await LinkFivePurchases.purchase( productDetails );
```

### Restore a Purchases

All restored subscriptions will be available through activeProducts. [Restore Docs](https://www.linkfive.io/docs/flutter/restore-a-purchase/)

```dart
LinkFivePurchases.restore();
```

### Switch from one subscription plan to another

You can switch from one Subscription plan to another. Example: from currently a 1 month subscription to a 3 months subscription. 

* On iOS: you can only switch to a plan which is in the same Subscription Family

The Proration Mode is Google Only. On default, it replaces immediately the subscription and the remaining time will be prorated and credited to the user. You can specify a different proration mode.

```dart
LinkFivePurchases.switchPlan(
  oldPurchaseDetails, 
  linkFiveProductDetails.productDetails,
  prorationMode: ProrationMode.immediateWithTimeProration
);
```

### Provider example
Here is an example of a Provider Plugin which you can implement as a ChangeNotifier

```dart
class LinkFiveProvider extends ChangeNotifier {
  LinkFiveProducts? products;
  LinkFiveActiveProducts? activeProducts;

  /// Streams that will be cleaned on dispose
  List<StreamSubscription> _streams = [];

  /// All verified Plans as List or emptyList
  List<LinkFivePlan> get activePlanList => activeProducts?.planList ?? [];

  /// LinkFive as CallbackInterface for your Paywall
  CallbackInterface get callbackInterface => LinkFivePurchases.callbackInterface;

  /// conveniently check if the user has any activeProducts
  bool get hasActiveProduct => activeProducts != null && activeProducts!.planList.isNotEmpty;

  /// Initialize LinkFive with your Api Key
  ///
  /// Please register on our website: https://www.linkfive.io to get an api key
  LinkFiveProvider(String apiKey, {LinkFiveLogLevel logLevel = LinkFiveLogLevel.DEBUG}) {
    LinkFivePurchases.init(apiKey, logLevel: logLevel);
    _streams.add(LinkFivePurchases.products.listen(_productsUpdate));
    _streams.add(LinkFivePurchases.activeProducts.listen(_activeProductsUpdate));
  }

  /// Saves available Products and notifies all listeners
  void _productsUpdate(LinkFiveProducts data) async {
    products = data;
    notifyListeners();
  }

  /// Saves active Products and notifies all listeners
  void _activeProductsUpdate(LinkFiveActiveProducts data) {
    activeProducts = data;
    notifyListeners();
  }

  Future<LinkFiveProducts?> fetchProducts() {
    return LinkFivePurchases.fetchProducts();
  }

  Future<bool> restoreSubscriptions() {
    return LinkFivePurchases.restore();
  }

  Future<bool> purchase(ProductDetails productDetail) async {
    return LinkFivePurchases.purchase(productDetail);
  }

  switchPlan(LinkFivePlan oldPurchasePlan, LinkFiveProductDetails productDetails, {ProrationMode? prorationMode}) {
    return LinkFivePurchases.switchPlan(oldPurchasePlan, productDetails, prorationMode: prorationMode);
  }

  @override
  void dispose() async {
    for (final element in _streams) {
      await element.cancel();
    }
    _streams = [];
    super.dispose();
  }
}
```

## StreamBuilder Example

If you're mainly using a StreamBuilder, here is how it works with LinkFive:

Show all available Products:

```dart
StreamBuilder<LinkFiveProducts>(
  stream: LinkFivePurchases.products,
  builder: (context, snapshot) {
    if (snapshot.hasData) {
     var productData = snapshot.data;
      if(productData != null) {
      // productData to offer
     }
    }
  return Center(child: Text('Loading...'));
  })
```

Get all Active products

```dart
StreamBuilder<LinkFiveActiveProducts>(
  stream: LinkFivePurchases.activeProducts,
  builder: (BuildContext context, snapshot) {
    if (snapshot.hasData) {
      var activeProductsData = snapshot.data;
      if (activeProductsData != null) {
        // activeProductsData to offer
      }
    }
    return Center(child: Text('Loading...'));
  },
)
```

## Easy Integration with the Paywall UI package

Integrate linkfive_purchases with package [in_app_purchases_paywall_ui](https://pub.dev/packages/in_app_purchases_paywall_ui).

* it's working with just passing the LinkFive client to the UI library
* Automatic purchase state management
* The UI is fully customizable
* You can control the UI on our [Website](https://www.linkfive.io)

### Purchase Page

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LinkFive/flutter-purchases-sdk/master/resources/simple_paywall_design.png" alt="Simple Paywall"/>

### Success Page

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LinkFive/flutter-purchases-sdk/master/resources/simple_paywall_design_success.png" alt="Simple Success page Paywall"/>

### Page State Management

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LinkFive/flutter-purchases-sdk/master/resources/state_management_control.gif" alt="Simple Paywall Success state"/>

### Example usage with Paywall UI
usage with [in_app_purchases_paywall_ui](https://pub.dev/packages/in_app_purchases_paywall_ui).

```dart

// get subscription data from your provider or from your stream (as described above)
LinkFiveProducts? products = // your products you got through the products Stream

SimplePaywall(
  // ...
  // basically just the linkFivePurchases class
  callbackInterface: LinkFivePurchases.callbackInterface,

  // you can use your own strings or use the intl package to automatically generate the subscription strings
  subscriptionListData: _buildPaywallData(context, provider.products),
  // ...
);

List<SubscriptionData>? _buildPaywallData(BuildContext context, LinkFiveProducts? products) {
  if (products == null) {
    return null;
  }
  final subList = <SubscriptionData>[];

  for (final product in products.productDetailList) {
    final pricingPhase = product.pricingPhases.first;
    final durationStrings = pricingPhase.billingPeriod.jsonValue.fromIso8601(PaywallL10NHelper.of(context));
    final data = SubscriptionData(
      durationTitle: durationStrings.durationTextNumber,
      durationShort: durationStrings.durationText,
      price: pricingPhase.formattedPrice,
      productDetails: product.productDetails,
    );
    subList.add(data);
  }

  return subList;
}
```

Thatâ€˜s it. Now the page will automatically offer the subscriptions to the user or if the user already bought the subscription, the paywall will show the success page.
